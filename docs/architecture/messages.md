# Direct messages

Persisted 1:1 conversations (`Vutuv.Chat`) at `/messages`, with live delivery,
typing indicators and online dots.

Anyone validated can write to anyone, but the conversation lands directly only
when the **recipient already follows the sender** — otherwise it is a **message
request** the recipient accepts (explicitly or by replying) or declines;
declining is silent (the sender cannot tell it from being ignored) and opening
new requests is rate-limited.

The shell badge counts conversations with unread messages, and a debounced email
quotes the message and points the recipient back at the thread.

Each member controls this on the notifications settings page: whether they are
emailed about **every** unread message or only the **first** of a burst (the
default), and how long a message may sit unread before the email goes out (0 to
120 minutes, default 15); every such email says which mode is active and
deep-links to those settings.
