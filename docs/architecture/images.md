# Images

The image pipeline behind avatars, cover photos, URL screenshots and post
images. How post images are uploaded and audience-guarded is part of
[posts-and-feed.md](posts-and-feed.md); this document covers what all images
share.

## The pipeline

Avatars, profile cover photos, URL screenshots and post images are stored on
local disk and processed with [`image`](https://hex.pm/packages/image)
(libvips); see `Vutuv.Avatar` / `Vutuv.Cover` / `Vutuv.Screenshot` /
`Vutuv.PostImageStore`.

**Every served version is AVIF**; the resolution, crop and quality of every
version live in one module, `Vutuv.Uploads.Spec`, so a future format/compression
change is a Spec edit plus one `mix vutuv.images.regenerate` run.

Every uploaded **original** is kept verbatim (format + metadata) under the
private `<UPLOADS_DIR_PREFIX>/originals/` tree (`Vutuv.Uploads.Originals`) as
the source for re-deriving — it must **never** be served (no `Plug.Static`
mount, no nginx alias; a regression test enforces this).

Cover photos are uploaded via the Edit profile form and served from
`<UPLOADS_DIR_PREFIX>/covers/` (nginx needs a `location /covers/` alias in
production, mirroring `/avatars/`)

## Fingerprinted avatar/cover filenames

Avatar and cover files are named `<handle>-<version>-<fingerprint>.avif` (e.g.
`swintermeyer-medium-1a2b3c4d.avif`), where the fingerprint is
`sha256(original)[0..11]`.

The handle makes a downloaded file carry the username; the fingerprint makes the
URL immutable, so it needs no `?v=` cache-buster and the **existing** nginx
`alias` serves it directly (no rewrite).

The fingerprint is stored in `users.avatar_fingerprint` / `cover_fingerprint`; a
username change re-derives the files under the new handle. A row with no
fingerprint has not been migrated yet and serves the legacy
`avatar_<version>.avif?v=...` URL unchanged.

The migration is **expand/contract**: the regenerator writes the new files and
**keeps** the legacy ones (so the previous release and a rollback keep serving
them); once the scheme is confirmed healthy in production, `mix
vutuv.images.sweep_legacy` (`Vutuv.Release.sweep_legacy_images()`) deletes the
legacy files — a deliberate, manual step, never part of the deploy

## URL screenshots

URL screenshots are rendered by local headless Chromium, wrapped in a browser
window frame (`Vutuv.BrowserFrame`); see `Vutuv.PageScreenshot`. Needs a
`chromium`/`chrome` binary on the host (set `CHROMIUM_PATH` if it is not on
`$PATH`)
